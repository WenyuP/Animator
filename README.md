In this project, I created an interactive animator which it supports the following functions:
(1) Shapes: The program supports drawing and generating animations of three types of shapes: Oval, Rectangle and Plus-shape.
(2) Read from file: The program can read from the input file for the detailed information of shapes, the detailed infromation of the movement of shapes as time pass by.
(3) Views: The program supports three views for the user. They are:
3.1 Text view: This view will show a textual description of the animation. 
3.2 Interactive view: This view shows the actual drawing of the animation using Java Swing Library, with exteranl functions that allow users to start, pause, resume, restart, enable/disable looping, increase or decrease the speed of the animation, switch to outlined mode, switch to slow-motion.
3.3 SVG view: This view is a textual description of the animation that is compliant with the popular SVG file format.
